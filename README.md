journal_coverage
================

Checks SFX coverage against the catalogue

Given an SFX target report (in XML), the program
- searches the catalogue for the journal title (using Sirsi Web Services)
- compares it to the date range for the journal records
- writes a report of mismatched data

This application is my first attempt at 100% test-first development
